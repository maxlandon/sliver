This library is a modern, pure Go readline implementation, enhanced with editing and user 
interface features commonly found in modern shells, all in little more than 10K lines of code.
Its kemap-based model and completion engine is heavily inspired from the Z-Shell architecture.
It is used, between others, to power the [console](https://github.com/reeflective/console) library.


## Features

### Editing
- Near-native Emacs and Vim modes.
- Configurable bind keymaps, with live reload and sane defaults.
- [Extended list](https://github.com/reeflective/readline/wiki/Keymaps-&-Widgets) of edition/movement/control widgets (Emacs and Vim).
- Extended surround select/change/add fonctionality, with highlighting.
- Keywords switching (operators, booleans, hex/binary/digit) with iterations.
- Support for Vim Visual/Operator pending mode & cursor styles indications.
- Vim Insert and Replace (once/many).
- Many Vim text objects.
- All Vim registers, with completion support.
- Undo/redo history.
- Command-line edition in `$EDITOR`.
- Support for an arbitrary number of history sources.

### Interface
- Support for most of [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) prompts (PS1/PS2/RPROMPT/transient/tooltip).
- Extended completion system, keymap-based and configurable, easy to populate & use.
- Multiple completion display styles, with color support.
- Completion & History incremental search system & highlighting (fuzzy-search).
- Automatic & context-aware suffix removal for efficient flags/path/list completion.
- Optional asynchronous autocomplete.
- Usage/hint message display.
- Support for syntax highlighting


## Documentation

Readline is used by the [console library](https://github.com/reeflective/console) and its [example binary](https://github.com/reeflective/console/tree/main/example). To get a grasp of the 
functionality provided by readline and its default configuration, install and start the binary.

## Status

This library is in a pre-release status, although pretending to be quite bug-free as compared to its feature set.
Please open a PR or an issue if you wish to bring enhancements to it. 
Other contributions, as well as bug fixes and reviews are also welcome.

## Credits

- While most of the code has been rewritten from scratch, the original library used 
  is [lmorg/readline](https://github.com/lmorg/readline). I would have never ventured myself doing this if he had not 
  ventured writing a Vim mode core in the first place. 
- Some of the Vim code is inspired or translated from [zsh-vi-mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode).
